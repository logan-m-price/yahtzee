This is a program for playing Yahtzee, designed and written by 
Logan Price, Billy Pilkin, and Petter Johansen.

The images and rules.txt file are required for playing this game 
and must be stored in the same folder as the Yahtzee.exe file to 
operate correctly. Source code written in Python 3.7 are contained
inside the src folder.

We did not make nor claim to have made any of the pictures used 
in this project. We claim fair use on these as they are used in 
the intention of education and are not used for nor result in any 
monetary gain.
